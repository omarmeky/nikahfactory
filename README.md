This is a project I worked on some time ago. It has an Entity Framework/ASP.NET MVC Web API back end and an AngularJS front end. I removed css since some of it was proprietary. Also, some of the folders got jumbled up.

Disclaimer: This is an OLD (2013) somewhat quickly written project. It likely has various bad conventions and technical debt. Take it with a grain of salt (or pepper).
